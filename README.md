## üöÄ **How to Start**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Clone the Repository**

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Open in VS Code**
    Open the project directory in Visual Studio Code.
    Open the integrated terminal (Ctrl + ~), and create two terminal tabs:
    One for the Flask server.
    One for server monitoring.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Run Setup.sh
In the first terminal tab, run the setup script to initialize the Flask server, install dependencies, and set up the project:
bash Setup.sh
This will automatically start the Flask server.

Open the monitoring.py file in the project directory.
Add your email credentials in the required sections.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Run monitoring.py
In the second terminal tab, run the monitoring script:
python3 monitoring.py

Functionality:

If the server stops, it sends an email alert.
It logs the server's status and timestamp in the server_status.log file located in the same directory.

    Open your web browser and go to:
    http://localhost:5000

    Ensure your email credentials are correctly configured in monitoring.py.
    The Flask server and the monitoring script should always run in separate terminals.
