Mail Monitoring and Alert System

This project scans your email inbox for client mails, sends instant alerts upon detection, and maintains a log of all alerts for generating reports. Additionally, it includes server monitoring and a user authentication mechanism.

How to Start
Clone the Repository

Open the project directory in Visual Studio Code.
Open the integrated terminal (Ctrl + ~), and create two terminal tabs:
One for the Flask server.
One for server monitoring.

In the first terminal tab, run the setup script to initialize the Flask server, install dependencies, and set up the project:
bash Setup.sh
This will automatically start the Flask server.


Edit Credentials for Monitoring
Open the monitoring.py file in the project directory.
Add your email credentials in the required sections.
Run monitoring.py

In the second terminal tab, run the monitoring script:
python3 monitoring.py
Functionality:
Every 30 minutes, this script checks if the server is running.
If the server stops, it sends an email alert.
It logs the server's status and timestamp in the server_status.log file located in the same directory.


Access the Application
Open your web browser and go to:
http://localhost:5000


Notes
Ensure your email credentials are correctly configured in monitoring.py.
The Flask server and the monitoring script should always run in separate terminals.
